        <p>"Viva La Vida"
            
            I used to rule the world
            Seas would rise when I gave the word
            Now in the morning I sleep alone
            Sweep the streets I used to own
            
            I used to roll the dice
            Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
            Listened as the crowd would sing,
            "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
            One minute I held the key
            Next the walls were closed on me
            And I discovered that my castles stand
            Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
        <div class="hook">
            I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield
            My missionaries in a foreign field
            For some reason I can't explain
            Once you'd gone there was never
            Never an honest word
            And that was when I ruled the world
        </div>
            It was a wicked and wild wind
            Blew down the doors to let me in
            Shattered windows and the sound of drums
            People couldn't believe what I'd become
            Revolutionaries wait
            For my head on a silver plate
            Just a puppet on a lonely string
            Oh who would ever want to be king?
        <div class="hook">
            I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield
            My missionaries in a foreign field
            For some reason I can't explain
            I know St. Peter won't call my name
            Never an honest word
            But that was when I ruled the world
        </div>    
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [5x]
        <div class="hook">
            Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield
            My missionaries in a foreign field
            For some reason I can't explain
            I know St. Peter won't call my name
            Never an honest word
